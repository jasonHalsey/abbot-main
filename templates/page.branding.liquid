          <p>In 2012, Abbot + Main was founded with a fundamental premise: create a collection of wardrobe essentials for men and women focusing on soft-handed fabrications and thoughtful design elements.</p>
          <p>Our story began in Los Angeles, with a combined vision between actor Kellan Lutz and fashion mogul Daniel Guez, to create an iconic brand using the laid-back spirit of the Southern California beach scene, particularly Venice Beach, where Abbot Kinney and Main Street collide.</p>
